This solution was created in Visual Studio 2019.  You should be able to use VS 2019 Community (which is free) to complete the work.

The projects in the solution are ordered by difficulty.

The last project (3.BonusChallenge) is optional.

The intent behind these challenges is to provide you with different levels of difficulty where you can showcase your skills, experience, and style.

We will use your solutions to these problems as talking points in the technical interview.

We expect and trust you to do this work yourself.  

Questions are welcome and expected.


1.DoThisFirst

- The Program.cs file contains a comments section that describe what we expect.
- This is a very easy exercise that should be something you can do in less than an hour.
- Obviously, do this one first.

2.DoThisNext

- Program.cs file contains a comments section that describe what we expect.
- This project is a little more challenging, but should be something you can do in a few hours.

3.BonusChallenge

- This has a readme file at the root of the project with further instructions and requirements.  
- This is a more difficult challenge - as such, it is optional.
- Feel free to submit a partially complete project - as long as we can debug, its fine.


When you are done, create a pull request.  :)

Please send it in at least 24 hours before your Technical interview so that we have time to review it.
